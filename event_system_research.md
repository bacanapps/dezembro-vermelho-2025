**Organization**: Atria Eventos (Mid-size event producer)
**Size**: 25 employees, 200 events/year
**Current Situation**: Using Sympla, paying 5% per registration
**Pain Points**:
- Current costs: ~$15K/year in platform fees
- Can't white-label (Sympla branding shows)
- Limited customization per client
- No way to track across all client events
- Clients asking for lower event costs

**Why They'd Buy**:
- White-label tier ($499/month = $5,988/year)
- Saves $9K/year vs. current solution
- Can charge clients $99/event (markup)
- Professional brand presentation
- Unlimited events = grow without cost scaling

**Willingness to Pay**: $499/month (White-label tier)
**Lifetime Value**: $18,000+ (3-year avg, high retention)
